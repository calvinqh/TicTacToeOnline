# Tic Tac Toe


## To play:

One person runs server file.
Another person runs client file to connect to server.


## To Do:


* Give server player GUI to play with rather than playing through text commands.


* Lets random player go first rather than have the client play first everytime.


* Update game model by sending moves rather than entire board. This is for efficiency reasons.


* Fix View formating. Sizers are currently a problem.


* Allow users to connect to enter IP they wish to connect to.


* Fix folder format.
